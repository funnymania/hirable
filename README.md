# Hirable!

Want to get a job in tech, but were late to the party?

Are you getting frustrated applying over and over again, only
to realize you are applying as the 900th in line to an old
job posting that has been re-posted to linkedin / whereever?

Want to actually be alerted when an actual new job from Twitter
pops up? :)

Now that's what I call Hirable!

# Instructions

`npm i`
`node app.js`

Every 3 minutes, the site(s) are scraped, and you are alerted
that your time has come! 

You can find the results in relevant subFolders for each listing
successfully scraped. 

Place your email in 'userEmail.txt' if you would like to be informed
via email, too. 

Amuse your friends with your new, shiny offer! 

NO MONEY BACK GUARANTEE
EXTEND AT YOUR OWN RISK
AND MAYBE SUBMIT A PR

# Also

Developed on WSL.

Some sites actually have scraping APIs for you to play around 
with, so, feel free to look into that, too.
